## Game Rules

The game board consists of a number of cards. Each card has a pair. The goal of the game is to find all pairs. When you click on a card, it flips to reveal its content. If you flip two cards with the same content consecutively, it's a match and the cards stay flipped. The game ends when all pairs are found.
